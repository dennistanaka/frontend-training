Simple todo app made by following the [tutorial at CodingTheSmartWay.com](https://codingthesmartway.com/building-a-vanilla-javascript-todo-app-from-start-to-finish-ep-1-introduction-project-setup/)

The main goal was to get used to the [BEM methodology](http://getbem.com/introduction/). As such, the CSS presented by the tutorial was modified accordingly.

Other than that, only small style changes were applied, such as changing the logo to an open-source illustration from [unDrawn](https://undraw.co/).
